# Path-finding-algorithm-GUI

Tkinter GUI with path finding algorith as visual medium. You draw start and end (goal), after that you can draw walls and choose algorithm. Righ now there is only breath first search algorithm (I'm planning to add dijsktra and a* (and zooming feature for canvas)).
Program show steps and time it took to compute. After algorithm computing you can draw with highlight color. If you want use program again, you need press restart button.

Algorithm is also explained within the code.

BTW: I tried this before without any knowledge how path finding algorihms works, I just made one similiar to breath first search, when I made bucket function for my pixel painter. Program actually worked, despite its size was excessively huge, but I didn't know how to properly track steps (path) and I wasn't.
